IT WORKS! We successfully made water from the air at NIMBY<sup>[0](#0)</sup> in Oakland, California. Don’t worry, we filtered the water (reverse osmosis) before we drank it.

MacGyver would be proud: we were able to pull ordinary off the shelf parts together to make this prototype function.<sup>[fig0](#fig0)</sup> We are successfully generating water from thin air! BlueIce Alpha, the first prototype of our large-scale AWG (atmospheric water generator),<sup>[1](#1)</sup> is able to generate 12 L of pre-filtered water per 24h at a cost of 1.4 kWh/L.<sup>[2](#2)</sup>

We have come a long way since we started in September with a scavenged thermoelectric heat pump and small heat exchanger.<sup>[fig1](#fig1)</sup> <sup>[fig2](#fig2)</sup> The alpha build has taken shape and is currently NIMBY's first atmospheric water generator! But it doesn’t end there for us, we are already working on increasing the structure’s size and water generating capacity.

BlueIce Alpha is our first prototype AWG with the [reword this] eventual goal of openAWG v1, which can supply 1,300 L / 24h pre-filtered @ 612 Wh/L.<sup>[3](#3)</sup> BlueIce will also be used as a basis for fundraising. We plan to produce the drinking water served at our fundraising events and hope to auction off the prototype.

We are constructing test rigs to automate experiments that will inform our implementation as the project progresses towards openAWG v1 deployment at BRC. The final BlueIce release is simply a scaled version of BlueIce Alpha -- with more dehumidifiers collecting water from the air.

The next steps ahead of us are collecting samples to send to the lab, finishing up our Indiegogo campaign, and getting the documentation caught up to the implementation so we can open source<sup>[4](#4)</sup> the alpha release.

So hey, we’re building this machine that makes water from thin air. A lot of it. 1.3 metric tons every day to be exact. And it will cost a cool $125k. I’m also going to need a 100MB/s upload connection from BRC, a couple more shipping containers, and 60kw of power. I hope that’s not going to be a problem.
